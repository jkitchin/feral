//! Fiduccia-Mattheyses refinement.
//!
//! Two refinement kernels:
//!
//! - `refine_bisection`: classic FM with best-balanced rollback.
//!   Picks the highest-gain boundary vertex, flips its partition,
//!   updates neighbor gains, locks it, and repeats. Tracks both
//!   "current cut" and "best cut subject to balance" separately; at
//!   the end of the pass rolls back to the best balanced state.
//! - `refine_separator`: greedy node-separator reduction. For each
//!   separator vertex it computes the gain (weight saved by pulling
//!   the vertex out of the separator, minus weight of neighbors on
//!   the far side that would need to enter the separator). Accepts
//!   only positive-gain moves that respect the balance constraint.
//!   A full two-sided FM with negative-gain acceptance is deferred
//!   until a concrete quality gap motivates it.
//!
//! Priority queue: a lazy `BinaryHeap<(gain, Reverse(v))>` rather
//! than METIS's bucket array. Correct; the O(log n) overhead per
//! operation is acceptable at the graph sizes FERAL targets
//! (≤ 100k vertices, FM rarely dominates runtime).
