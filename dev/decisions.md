## 2026-04-12 — Phase 1b exit criterion via multi-source consensus

**Decision.** The strict 100%-correct-vs-rmumps Phase 1b exit criterion in
`FERAL-PROJECT-SPEC.md` §1712 is superseded for the purpose of declaring
Phase 1b complete. The new criterion is multi-source consensus across four
solvers: feral, rmumps, canonical Fortran MUMPS 5.8.2 (built from
`ref/mumps`), and canonical Fortran SSIDS (built from `ref/spral`). For
each matrix in the 153k KKT corpus, classify as **Definitive**, **Borderline**,
**Numerically intractable**, or **Excluded** based on inertia and residual
agreement across the four solvers. Phase 1b exits when feral satisfies the
per-matrix verdict for every Definitive matrix.

Full plan: `dev/plans/phase-1b-consensus-exit.md`.

**Why.** After this session's three structural fixes (postorder pipeline,
best-iterate refinement, factor/solve threshold consistency), feral sits
at 99.2-99.8% on the 153k corpus. The triage of the remaining failures
shows three categories:

1. ~880 matrices where feral solves correctly (residual at machine
   precision) but disagrees with rmumps on the inertia label of
   boundary pivots — feral is not wrong, the oracle disagrees with it
   on a definitional choice.
2. ~400 matrices in problem families (ACOPP30, FBRAIN3LS, CERI*, HS46,
   PFIT2, ...) where ForceAccept on rank-deficient KKTs produces wrong
   `A⁻¹`. The principled fix is delayed pivoting, a Phase 2 feature.
3. 88 sparse-only failures, possibly a sparse-pipeline bug like the
   postorder issue.

The deeper concern: rmumps is a Rust port of MUMPS authored by the same
person developing feral. Treating it as ground truth means a bug in
rmumps and a matching bug in feral would both look like "100% pass"
forever. A multi-oracle consensus catches this class of failure and is
also more honest about matrices where the right answer is genuinely
ambiguous in double precision.

**Reconsideration clause.** This decision is **revisitable**. If running
the consensus across all four solvers reveals that the canonical Fortran
oracles agree with rmumps to within float64 precision on essentially the
entire corpus, then the multi-source machinery has not improved the
ground truth and the original strict criterion can be reinstated. If
the oracles disagree substantially, the consensus criterion stays. The
data from Phases 3-5 of `phase-1b-consensus-exit.md` will tell us which
world we live in.

**Constraints unchanged.** Feral itself remains pure Rust with zero
non-Rust dependencies in the core solver. The Fortran oracles live in a
new top-level `external_benchmarks/` directory, are not built by cargo,
and are not in CI. They are run manually as one-time test infrastructure.
